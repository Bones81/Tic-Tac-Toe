# Tic-Tac-Toe
The Odin Project's Ruby Progamming Tic-Tac-Toe assignment 

Clearly still a Ruby novice. This was the first project in The Odin Project's Ruby course after learning the basic precepts of OOP. Took a while to grasp the usefulness of arranging modules and classes in the preferred ways, and I'm sure I have loads more to learn and that there are plenty of ways I could improve this code. 

That said, I see that the number of combined lines of code I used is comparable to that of the top example solution on The Odin Project's page for this Tic Tac Toe project. So that gives me some hope that maybe I'm not as inefficient in my code as I fear. 

Also saw several other solutions after completing my own, and I can see how there are numerous ways to code this game effectively. 

Gonna move on for now. 3/29/21
